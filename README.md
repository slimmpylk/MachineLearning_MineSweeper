Overview

MachineLearning_MineSweeper is an AI-powered project that automates the process of playing Minesweeper. The AI uses image recognition and basic logic to autonomously play the game and aims to win every time.
Features

    Automated Gameplay: The AI plays Minesweeper autonomously using image recognition.
    Data Collection: Records game data to improve AI decision-making over time.
    Real-time Mouse Tracking: Tracks mouse movements to aid in identifying game elements.

File Descriptions

    TemplateMatching.py: Captures screenshots of specific elements in the game (e.g., unopened cells) to create templates for image recognition.
    minesweeper_autogui.py: The main script for automating Minesweeper gameplay. It uses PyAutoGUI for interaction, OpenCV for image processing, and CSV for data recording.
    realtimeMousetracker.py: A utility script to track and print real-time mouse positions. (not necessary anymore, just used to make sure where game window was on screen)
