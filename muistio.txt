To make your data collection more generalizable
 to different board sizes and variants of Minesweeper,
  you can record cell positions as row and column indices
  rather than pixel coordinates.
  This way, the AI learns patterns based on logical
  board positions rather than specific screen coordinates.
  When you move to a different board (with different pixel
  dimensions or different screen locations), you can use the
   same logic as long as you can determine the cell size and indexing.
